# sparse-plex

NOTE: Please visit [cr-sparse](https://github.com/carnotresearch/cr-sparse) for an up-to-date functional implementation in Python using Google JAX which is hardware accelerated for CPU/GPU/TPUs. Thus, same code works on all types of hardware.  [Docs](https://cr-sparse.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). All activate development is happening in [cr-sparse](https://github.com/carnotresearch/cr-sparse) only. `sparse-plex` is now in maintenance mode.  

A  MATLAB library for exploiting the sparsity in data representations for solving
real life problems. 

Keywords: 

* Sparse representations
* Compressive sensing
* Sparse recovery : OMP, CoSaMP, BP, ORMP, OLS, IHT, HTP
* Subspace clustering
* Joint recovery
* SMV vs MMV problems
* Dictionary learning, MOD, K-SVD
